Read me - Supporting folder


Two folders:

"Prepare_trial_data_and_analyse""

This folder contains the code and data used to extract trial data from Yoda, Vivli 
and GSK and run the MVP model on each trial and then combine the model outputs for 
each trial into a single dataframe for each location in which the trials were 
extracted and analysed.

The key outputs from these folders are also held in the Data folder in the 1st 
level of this repo as they are combined into a single dataframe of all trials, 
to be comapred with the community.

The key outputs from the three folders (GSK, Vivli, and Yoda) are listed below, 
they contain the estimated comorbidity correlations (summaries and MCMC draws) 
from each trial model (1 per trial):

  - GSK_omega_draws
  - GSK_trial_omega_summaries
  - yoda_omega_draws_final
  - yoda_omega_summary_final
  - vivli_omega_draws
  - vivli_omega_summary_final
  

Please note we do not provide the trial data to protect participant confidentialty,
as such many of the scripts cannot be run. 



"Real_vs_pseudo_IPD_comparison""

This folder contains the script/data used to compare real vs simulated pseudo 
community IPD (from aggregate data). It highlights the minimal difference in
analysing simulated data compared with analysing the communtiy directly.
