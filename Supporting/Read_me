"Prepare_trial_data_and_analyse""

Contains the code used to extract trial data from Yoda, Vivli 
and GSK and run the MVP model on each trial.

The key outputs from the three folders (GSK, Vivli, and Yoda) are listed below, 
they contain the estimated comorbidity correlations (summaries and MCMC draws) 
from each trial model (1 per trial):

  - GSK_omega_draws
  - GSK_trial_omega_summaries
  - yoda_omega_draws_final
  - yoda_omega_summary_final
  - vivli_omega_draws
  - vivli_omega_summary_final
  
Please note we do not provide the trial data to protect participant confidentialty,
as such many of the scripts cannot be run. 



"Real_vs_pseudo_IPD_comparison""

Contains the script/data used to compare real vs simulated pseudo 
community IPD (from aggregate data). It highlights the minimal difference in
analysing simulated data compared with analysing the communtiy data directly.
