The folders within "Prepare_trial_data_and_analyse" contain the scripts used
to extract trials from the trial repository, identify comorbidities and analyse
the trial data.

Due to patient confidentialty IPD cannot be exported, hence, these scripts cannot
actually be run in earnest. They are provided for transperency, and to illustrate 
how we extracted, identified and analysed comorbidities in trials. 

We have included all files used and created that do not contain sensitive individual 
level patient data.

The key outputs from the GSK, Vivli, and Yoda folders are listed below, 
they contain the estimated comorbidity correlations (summaries and MCMC draws) 
from each trial model (1 per trial):

  - GSK_omega_draws
  - GSK_trial_omega_summaries
  - yoda_omega_draws_final
  - yoda_omega_summary_final
  - vivli_omega_draws
  - vivli_omega_summary_final
