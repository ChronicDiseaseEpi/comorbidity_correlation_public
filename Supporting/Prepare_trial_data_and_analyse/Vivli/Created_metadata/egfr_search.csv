    in eCRF) and the via central laboratory. A positive result triggers the sampling of mid-stream
 urine for urine culture.
 Albumin/creatinine ratio and the α1 microglobulin/creatinine ratio in spot urine will be
 calculated at the central laboratory.
 The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) will be derived from serum creatinine values
 based on the MDRD formula:
 eGFR (ml/min) = 175 x [Screatinine (umol/L)/88.4]-1.154 x [age]-0.203 x [0.742 if patient is
 female] x [1.212 if patient is of African origin]
 Renal function impairment will be classified in the f_ollowing way:
     • _   No renal function impairment: eGFR ≥90 ml/min (not eligible for this trial)
  _   •    Mild renal function impairment: eGFR ≥60 and <90 ml/min
     •    Moderate renal function impairment: eGFR ≥30 and <60 ml/min
     •    Severe renal function impairment: eGFR ≥15 and <30 ml/min.
 These classes of renal impairment will be the ba_sis for stratification at randomisation and
 subgroup analysis.
