        Creatinine clearance and glomerular filtration rate
        The eCCr (Cockcroft-Gault formula) and eGFR (MDRD formula) will be calculated
        according to the two formulas:
        Cockcroft-Gault formula:
        eCCr (ml/min) = [140 – age] x [weight in kg] x [1.23 if patient is male or 1.04 if patie_nt is
        female]/ [72 x serum creatinine (µmol/L)]
        MDRD formula:
        eGFR (ml/min/1.73m2) = 175 x [serum creatinine (µmol/L)/88.4]-1.154 x [age]-0.203 x [0.742 if
        patient is female] x [1.212 if patient is of African origin]
        The race_ of the patient will be entered because T2DM treatment results may differ depending
        on race. Furthermore, the renal function will be assessed using the MDRD formula. This
        formula considers the race as an adjustment factor, therefore, the race must be known for
        accurate estimation.

 Reason for Change 6:

 underestimates the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) in patients with low body weight and in
 the elderly. On the other hand it overestimates the GFR in obese patients [R07-4216].
 Therefore the MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) formula will be used instead of
 the Cockcroft and Gault formula, as it is more precise in our target population. The actual
 GRF will still be underestimate_d with the MDRD formula, but would prov_ide a better
 estimate of GRF compared to the CG formula. The estimated creatinine clearance will be
 calculated with the MDRD formula by the central lab on screening lab tes_t, as done currently
 with the Cockcroft and Gault formula.
