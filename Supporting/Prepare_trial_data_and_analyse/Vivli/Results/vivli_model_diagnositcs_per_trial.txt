There were 12 warnings (use warnings() to see them)

Warning messages:
1: There were 14 divergent transitions after warmup. See
https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#divergent-transitions-after-warmup
to find out why this is a problem and how to eliminate them.
2: Examine the pairs() plot to diagnose sampling problems

3: Bulk Effective Samples Size (ESS) is too low, indicating posterior means and medians may be unreliable.
Running the chains for more iterations may help. See
https://mc-stan.org/misc/warnings.html#bulk-ess
4: There were 9 divergent transitions after warmup. See
